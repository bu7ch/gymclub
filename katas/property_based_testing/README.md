Property-Based Kata
===================

A simple exercise to demonstrate property-based testing, in a browser
context.

The lib that gives us this feature: https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js

List of base generators available : https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js/blob/master/type-definitions/testcheck.d.ts



Dependencies
------------

nodejs and npm

Install
-------

Be sure of using a recent version of node... for example with nvm
```
nvm use v0.10.30
```

Then install it
```
npm install
```


Run it
------

This gives you an auto-reload that will watch js file changes and run `test.js`
```
npm run test-auto
```
